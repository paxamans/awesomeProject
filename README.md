# Awesome Autostart Manager(AAM) Alpha PreRelease Notes

  The AAM application is a new utility for managing autostart applications on Windows systems. This is the initial Alpha version and is designed for my own usage.

## Features

- **Autostart Application Overview**: The main window displays a table of all applications set to autostart on your Windows system. This includes both applications registered in the registry under `Software\Microsoft\Windows\CurrentVersion\Run` and shortcuts placed in the user's Startup folder.

- **Add Autostart Applications**: You can add new applications to the autostart list. The application lets you select an `.exe` file via a file dialog, which it then adds to your system's autostart settings.

## Known Limitations

Being an alpha version, this application comes with some limitations:

- The application has only been tested on a limited number of Windows configurations.
- The functionality for technically everything may not work properly.
- The GUI has been kept simple and lacks advanced user interface features.

## Future Developments

- More robust error handling and reporting.
- Broad testing on various Windows configurations.

We hope you enjoy using the alpha version of AAM and welcome any feedback you may have!
